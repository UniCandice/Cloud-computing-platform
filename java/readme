0.backup your old file which may be overwrote by follows

cfd_prefix means your root directory of your website ,/opt/web,for example
1.cp menu_main.php to cfd_prefix
2.cp l_upload.php to cfd_prefix
3.cp l_upload_file.php to cfd_prefix
4.cp UploadFile.jar  to jdkpath/jre/lib/ext/   (if you never install jdk, you should download jdk at 1.8 version.)
5.cp JavaBridge.jar  to jdkpath/jre/lib/ext/
6.cp Java.inc  to the path as l_upload_file.php said on line 54
7.mkdir cfd_prefix/uploadfiles   &&   chmod 777  cfd_prefix/uploadfiles

restart java or restart computer

1.java -jar jdkpath/jre/lib/ext/JavaBridge.jar
2.ok. login and do more test...


if you encounter any problem, the jdkpath/jre/lib/ext/JavaBridge.log will tell you something

one more thing, the jar uploader will take the file (who's names begins with 'ch') as Solver
